The SQL SELECT Statement - The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

    SELECT column1, column2, ... // select columns
    FROM table_name; // specifing table


To select all columns from table
SELECT * FROM table_name;


To avoid getting duplicate values
    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name


To count no. of rows
    SELECT COUNT(Country) FROM Customers

To avoid getting duplicate counts
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);



****** To filter use "WHERE" ******

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID=1;

        OR

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE City IN("Paris")

=	...  Equal	
>	...  Greater than	
<	...  Less than	
>=	...  Greater than or equal	
<=	...  Less than or equal	
<>	...  Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	 ...   Between a certain range	
LIKE	 ...   Search for a pattern	
IN	...  To specify multiple possible values for a column



*****  Order/Sort by  *****

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    ORDER BY ContactName;

order in descending order
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    ORDER BY ContactName DESC;


order in ascending order
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    ORDER BY ContactName ASC;



ORDER BY Several Columns Example
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;



*****  Insert  *****
keyword - INSERT INTO

    INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
    VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway'),


*****  Null or Not Null *****
    select * from table
    where City is not null


*****  Update table  *****
